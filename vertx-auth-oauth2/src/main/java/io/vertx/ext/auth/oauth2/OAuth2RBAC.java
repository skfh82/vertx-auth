/**
 * Functional interface that allows users to implement custom RBAC verifiers for OAuth2/OpenId Connect.
 *
 * Users are to implement the <code>isAuthorized</code> method to verify authorities. For provides that do not
 * export the permissions/roles in the token, this interface allows you to communicate with 3rd party services
 * such as graph APIs to collect the required data.
 *
 * The contract is that once an authority is checked for a given user, it's value is cached during the execution
 * of the request. If a user is stored to a persistent storage, or the token is introspected, the cache is cleared
 * and a new call will be handled to the implementation.
